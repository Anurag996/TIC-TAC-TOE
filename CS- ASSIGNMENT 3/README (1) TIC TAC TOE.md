## TIC TAC TOE !!!

1. # 🎮TIC-TAC-TOE GAME PROJECT (C LANGUAGE)

This repository contains a C implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, featuring both Player vs Player and Player vs Computer (unbeatable AI) gameplay modes.
The primary objective of this project is to create a clean, interactive, terminal-based strategy game with strong logic implementation.

# 2. ⭐ PROJECT OBJECTIVE

The purpose of this project is to create a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game using C language fundamentals, logical structures, and AI decision-making.
The game also helps learners understand:

1..  Decision trees

2.. Game-state evaluation

3.. Input handling

4.. UI rendering in console

5.. AI Minimax Algorithm (Perfect Play)

 # 3. ☑️ IMPLEMENTED FEATURES

From the game design plan, the following major features have been successfully implemented using the uploaded code 


### ✅ 1. Player vs Player Mode

Two players can play locally by entering the tile number (1–9).
The game ensures turn-based switching, valid move checks, and win/draw detection.

### ✅ 2. Player vs Computer (Unbeatable AI)

The AI uses the Minimax Algorithm, making it impossible to defeat.
It evaluates all possible outcomes and always plays the best move.

### ✅ 3. Clean & Numbered Board UI

The board displays numbers for empty cells, clearly showing available moves.
This improves user experience and avoids confusion.

### ✅ 4. Portable Screen Clear System


### ✅ 5. Input Validation

#### The program checks:

Correct numeric input

Range (1–9)

Empty cell requirement

Ensures smooth, error-free gameplay.

### ✅ 6. Replay System

After each match, the player can choose to play again without restarting the program.

# ⭐⭐ OTHER AVAILABLE (OPTIONAL) ENHANCEMENT IDEAS

These features can be added later for further expansion:

4️⃣ Score tracking system

5️⃣ Sound effects (Beep tones)

6️⃣ Multiple AI difficulty levels

7️⃣ Graphical (ASCII art) UI

9️⃣ Network multiplayer (advanced)

🔟 3×3, 4×4, or 5×5 board mode variations

  #  🚀HOW TO USE THIS REPOSITORY

1️⃣ Clone the project
git clone <your-repo-link>

2️⃣ Open the C file in your editor

File reference: tictactoe.c

3️⃣ Compile using GCC
gcc tictactoe.c -o tictactoe

4️⃣ Run the game
./tictactoe

# 🕹️ GAME RULES

The game is played on a 3×3 grid.

Players take turns placing X and O.

First player (X) always starts.

Win by forming a line of three marks:

1. Horizontal

2. Vertical

3. Diagonal

4. If all cells are filled without a winning line → DRAW.

# ☀️ IMPORTANT NOTES
```The Tic-Tac-Toe AI uses Minimax logic, ensuring optimal moves.
This makes the computer undefeated in logical play.

The project is a great exercise for:
1. C programming fundamentals
2. AI algorithm design
3. Game-state management
4. Problem-solving skills
5. Clean code structuring
