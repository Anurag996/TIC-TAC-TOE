# 1.🌤️C Program Enhancement Project

This repository contains a C program that will be extended by adding new features and improvements.
The goal of this project is to modify the existing code and implement additional functionality from the provided list of options.

# 2.⭐ Project Objective

Enhance the given C code by implementing one or more of the available improvement options.
These enhancements may include game mechanics, user interaction improvements, visual updates, or file-handling features.

# 3.☀️IMPLEMENTED ENHANCEMENTS



From the list of available improvement options, the following three features have been implemented:

✅ 1.
### Score System

A simple integer-based scoring mechanism has been added.

The score increases as the player survives or progresses in the game.

The score is displayed during gameplay and at the end of the game.

✅ 2.
### Player Lives System

The game now includes a lives system instead of immediate game over.

The player starts with a fixed number of lives (e.g., 3).

Each collision or mistake reduces one life.

The game ends only when all lives are lost.

✅ 3. 
### Difficulty Levels

The game now features dynamic difficulty.

The difficulty increases gradually as the game continues.

Speed or obstacle frequency becomes more challenging over time.

This creates a progressive and engaging experience.
